Drop your background image file here.

Recommended flow:
1. Copy your image into this folder, e.g. app/public/backgrounds/my-bg.jpg
2. Open app/lib/backgroundConfig.ts
3. Set imagePath to: /backgrounds/my-bg.jpg
4. Restart npm run dev if needed

The background is applied globally and scrolls with the page.
